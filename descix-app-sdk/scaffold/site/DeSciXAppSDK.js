 * ── What this file gives you ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One object, `DeSciX`, that works the same whether your page is embedded in the
 * DeSciX App Shell, nested deeper inside it, or opened standalone:
 *
 *     await DeSciX.ready();                      // is the shell's bus there?
 *     DeSciX.view.set('CodeSite');               // ask for the whole frame
 *     if (DeSciX.chat.available()) { … }         // can chat take an attachment now?
 *     await DeSciX.chat.sendMedia({ … });        // hand the model something to look at
 *     await DeSciX.call('some_command', { … });  // call the platform through the shell
 *
 * You never write `window.parent.` or `window.top.` — that hop is DETECTED, not
 * declared. The shell publishes its bus on its own window, so the correct level
 * depends on how deeply your app happens to be embedded, which your code cannot
 * know and should not have to. `resolveBridge()` below answers it on every access.
 *
 * Standalone is a first-class case, not a failure: with no shell above you,
 * `DeSciX.ready()` resolves `{ mode: 'standalone' }` (it does not hang), and
 * `DeSciX.view` / `DeSciX.chat` report their absence by name instead of throwing.
